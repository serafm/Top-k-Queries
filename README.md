## Introduction

In many applications, it is often necessary to retrieve the top-k elements based on certain criteria, such as popularity, relevance, or score. This project provides efficient algorithms to solve the top-k query problem, allowing users to retrieve the k highest or lowest ranked items from a given dataset. The implemented algorithms are suitable for a wide range of applications, including recommendation systems, search engines, and data analysis.

## Features

- **Top-k Query Algorithms**: The repository includes several algorithms for performing efficient top-k queries, such as the Threshold Algorithm, the Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm, and the Priority Queue Algorithm. Each algorithm is accompanied by a detailed explanation and usage example.
- **Variety of Ranking Criteria**: The implemented algorithms support various ranking criteria, allowing users to retrieve top-k elements based on different attributes or scores.
- **Optimized Performance**: The algorithms are designed to optimize performance and minimize computational complexity, ensuring efficient retrieval of the top-k elements even for large datasets.
- **Example Datasets**: We provide sample datasets for testing and experimentation. These datasets cover different domains and can be used to evaluate the algorithms' performance.
